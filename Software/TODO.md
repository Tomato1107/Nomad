# TODO:

1. Use Smart/Shared Ptrs Where we can.  Free up memory where we are not.
2. Add Logging/Plotting Interface to visualize trajectories [https://makersportal.com/blog/2018/8/14/real-time-graphing-in-python]
3. Leg Controller Task Node
4. RealTime Plotting Task Node
5. Gait Scheduler Phasing EQ mod(2*pi*T+phase_shift/gait_period), 2*pi)/2*pi = (0 to 1)
6. Finish Gazebo API controller example.  Then do (6)
7. Gazebo Model API to read from ZeroMQ Queue..  To make similar to real system we'll have one for each "leg".  4 Controller Topics.
8. Communications to Gazebo for Simulating OCP
9. "Discrete" Time System Classes
10. Bring up a good transformations library(RBDL, KDL, DART, or Custom w/ Eigen)
11. Swing Leg Trajectory/Controller
12. Joystick/Keyboard Input Operator Input
13. Start Ubuntu Server VM Image w/ PREEMPT RT and Test
14. ConvexMPC Wrapper (6D)
15. Forces to Torques w/ Jacobian
16. Move Port Class to own library -> Communications
